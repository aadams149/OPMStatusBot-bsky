# OPM Current Operating Status Bluesky Bot

This bot autoposts the Current Operating Status for U.S. federal buildings in the National Capitol Region. It checks the Office of Personnel Management's [Current Status API](https://www.opm.gov/developer/documentation/current-status-api/) every two hours, notes if the status has changed, and if it has, makes a post to Bluesky.

This bot is a personal project I undertook in order to learn a bit about Typescript and workflow automation. You can check out my other bot [here](https://github.com/aadams149/NameDayBot-bsky).

To build this bot, I used Phil Nash's [excellent template repository](github.com/philnash/bsky-bot). If you have any questions about the bot, feel free to reach out to me at opmstatusbot@alexanderjadams.com.
